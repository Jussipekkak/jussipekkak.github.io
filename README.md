"_Of course_," she whispered. Then, she shouted: "All I need is **a little moxie**!"  
If you're thinking to yourself, **_This is unbelievable_**, you'd probably be right.

I read this interesting quote the other day:

>"Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"
>Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo...
>
>His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a glass: he had a hairy face.
>
>He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.
>He left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to jibing and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her ware to another, a tourist from England or a student of Trinity. Grafton Street, along which he walked, prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he remembered having been present with his father at its laying. He remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick, a card on which were printed the words: _VIVE L'IRLANDE!_
* Flour
* Cheese
* Tomatoes
1. Cut the cheese
2. Slice the tomatoes
3. Rub the tomatoes in flour
* Azalea _(Ericaceae Rhododendron)_
* Chrysanthemum _(Anthemideae Chrysanthemum)_
* Dahlia _(Coreopsideae Dahlia)_
* Calculus
 * A professor
 * Has no hair
 * Often wears green
* Castafiore
 * An opera singer
 * Has white hair
 * Is possibly mentally unwell
 1. Cut the cheese
  
 Make sure that the cheese is cut into little triangles.

2. Slice the tomatoes
  
 Be careful when holding the knife.

 For more help on tomato slicing, see Thomas Jefferson's seminal essay _Tom Ate Those_.
 We pictured the meek mild creatures where  
They dwelt in their strawy pen,  
Nor did it occur to one of us there  
To doubt they were kneeling then.
1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.  
 Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.  
 If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!

2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.  
 Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!


 ## Exercise 2

 # LaTeX

>Latex is a markup language and free license software. It includes a set of built-in commands. It is a mode of mathematical and special symbols. LaTeX is generally distributed along with plain TEX, i.e., it provides a set of macros for TEX to interpret. The other macros for TEX are Plain TEX, GNU Texinfo, etc.   
    [Javatpoint/What-is-latex](https://www.javatpoint.com/what-is-latex)


## History of Latex

Latex was created by the American computer scientist named Leslie Lamport in 1983 when he was working at SRI International. LATEX was created as an addition to the Tex typesetting system and to make it easier to produce books and articles within TEX. Leslie Lamport was writing TEX for his use, while he thought that a little more effort could lead this to use by others as well. A person who convinced Leslie to write LATEX's user manual publication was an editor at the Addison-Wesley named Peter Gordon.

## Features of Latex

* Latex is a markup language and free license software. It includes a set of built-in commands.

* It is a mode of mathematical and special symbols.

* LaTeX is generally distributed along with plain TEX, i.e., it provides a set of macros for TEX to interpret. The other macros for TEX are Plain TEX, GNU Texinfo, etc.

* LaTeX is not compatible with the GNU (General Public License). It is available on most of the operating systems like UNIX, BSD, Linux, Windows, DOS, etc.



# LML

>**A lightweight markup language** **_(LML)_**, also termed a simple or humane markup language, is a markup language with simple, unobtrusive syntax. It is designed to be easy to write using any generic text editor and easy to read in its raw form. Lightweight markup languages are used in applications where it may be necessary to read the raw document as well as the final rendered output.  
For instance, a person downloading a software library might prefer to read the documentation in a text editor rather than a web browser. Another application for such languages is to provide for data entry in web-based publishing, such as weblogs and wikis, where the input interface is a simple text box. The server software then converts the input into a common document markup language like HTML.   
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language)

## History of LML

*Lightweight markup languages* were originally used on text-only displays which could not display characters in italics or bold, so informal methods to convey this information had to be developed. This formatting choice was naturally carried forth to plain-text email communications. Console browsers may also resort to similar display conventions.

In 1986 international standard [SGML](https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGML) provided facilities to define and parse lightweight markup languages using grammars and tag implication. The 1998 W3C XML is a profile of SGML that omits these facilities. However, no SGML document type definition (DTD) for any of the languages listed below is known.
